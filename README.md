How to run program:

1) Run the main() function from the Main class.



Design Patterns:

Builder Pattern was implemented to create various templates of the syllabus - in this case CS and SE Syllabus.

Decorator Pattern was used to modify the createSyllabus() function to instead fetch old syllabus details.

Adaptor Pattern was used to translate the publishSyllabusService() function to the equivalent Canvas service, publishSyllabusCavnas().

Facade Pattern was used to act as a controller class and wrap all the class functions in a single class for easy access by the Main Class to hide complexity of the code.

Singleton Pattern was used to implement a University Policies class that uses a timer that will fetch policies from an external source. For demo purposes, we have used a random function to determine if policies have been changed or not.
